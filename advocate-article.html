                            <p class="z">Oregun, a community in Lagos, Nigeria, is a small town within Ikeja, the capital of Lagos. Although, one would expect that Ikeja residents are economically advantaged, there are communities within Ikeja that shouldnâ€™t share such sentiments.</p>

                            <p class="z1">Oregun has poor people living in its community. This socio-economic status is seen to have ripple effects on the health of the citizens as the out-of-pocket costs scare people away from health centres to get diagnosed. The effect of this is that people living with the infection are left unaware and they continue to spread the disease until it becomes an outbreak.</p>
                                
                            <p class="z2">Unfortunately, Hepatitis B Virus(HBV) can only be detected when the blood is tested and symptoms would only begin to manifest 30 days to 6 months after infection. However, when symptoms begin to manifest, their appearance include yellowing of the skin and eyes(jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. The seroprevalence of the test at Oregun, Nigeria was 6.25% as 7 out of 112 people tested positive. The carriers of HBV in Oregun did not show any symptoms of infection, neither were they aware they were infected. Unprotected sexual activities,usage of local unsterilized blades for commercial barbing services and use ofunsterilized tools for facial marks and tattoos all increase the HBV infection rate.6However, just like HIV, it cannot be transmitted without exchange of serum.Although, research has shown that HBV is hyperendemic among women as it was in our case study in Oregun Nigeria where 4 out of the 7 positive results were women.</p>
